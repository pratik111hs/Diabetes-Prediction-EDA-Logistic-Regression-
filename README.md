# Diabetes-Prediction-Logistic-Regression-

## Here's a summary of the key steps involved:

* Load the data: The code loads the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset from a CSV file.
* Explore the data: The code analyzes the data to understand its characteristics, including missing values, data types, and the distribution of different features.
* Preprocess the data: The code performs necessary preprocessing steps like handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
* Split the data: The data is split into training and testing sets to train the model and evaluate its performance.
* Train the models: The code trains several machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Gradient Boosting Classifier.
* Evaluate the models: The code evaluates the performance of each model on the test set using metrics like accuracy and classification report.
* Select the best model: Based on the evaluation, the code identifies the Support Vector Machine (SVM) model as the best performer.
* Build a prediction system: The code creates a system that allows users to input patient data and get a prediction of whether they are likely to have diabetes.
